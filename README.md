# Surviving_the_Titanic

- Projected what sorts of people are more likely to survive than others, based on the Titanic incident.
- Developed a predictive model that projected the type of characteristices people have that would increase their chances of survival on Titanic.
- Analyzed and processed 891 data entries from a csv file and split it into two groups with 25% data for test set.
- Trained 75% of the data to build the machine learning model for providing the "growth truth" for each passenger based on age, gender and class.
- Inculcated Logistic Regression, and classification methods of KNN, SVM, K-SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forests to analyze the differences of the results based on different methods used for prediction.
